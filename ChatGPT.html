<p>The OpenAI company introduced the chat bot ChatGPT, which is called revolutionary. ChatGPT can have a conscious dialogue with the interlocutor: answer questions, give advice and explain complex concepts. In addition, the chatbot can find bugs in the code, compose poetry, write sonnets, come up with scripts and generate school essays on various topics. AI was trained on a huge amount of data from the Internet. After that, the company's testers evaluated the responses of earlier versions of the model, then the AI was retrained on the new information. We figured out what is interesting in ChatGPT and how to try the neural network yourself.</p>

<p>The American non-profit company OpenAI is engaged in machine learning technologies. One of its founders is Elon Musk. OpenAI is developing AI and looking for ways to apply it to simplify human life.</p>

<p>Open AI has released three versions of the GPT language model, which learns from texts from the Internet and can generate meaningful responses to questions. The GPT-3 version was considered the most advanced language model in the world.</p>

<p>GPT-3 has been criticized for not understanding context because it simply tries to predict the text word by word. ChatGPT is trained on the new version of the model - GPT-3.5. She handles context better by remembering the details of the conversation.</p>

<p> <h2>How the model differs from other text neural networks:</h2></p>

<p>ChatGPT has "memory". Unlike many neural network chatbots, ChatGPT remembers the details of the conversation and can build responses based on the information that the user has already given to it. For example, you can ask the chat what to give your mom for her birthday. The neural network will offer examples, ask about her interests, and answer questions about each gift offered. You can ask the bot again how the dialogue began: it will give a short summary.</p>

<p>ChatGPT avoids answering controversial topics. The chatbot does not express a personal opinion on any issues, does not have a race, does not profess religion, and also does not answer the question about the purpose of its existence. ChatGPT explains that it does not have the ability to think for itself. He also has filters that prevent him from creating texts about illegal or immoral activities. For example, the bot will not answer the question of how to break into someone else's apartment.</p>

<p>ChatGPT responses can be edited. If the bot read the context incorrectly, the user can ask a leading question or provide additional information to get the right answer from the AI.</p></div>
